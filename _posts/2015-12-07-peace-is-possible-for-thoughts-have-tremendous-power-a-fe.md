title: '"Peace is possible, for thoughts have tremendous power. A few really dedicated people can offset the ill effects of masses of out-of-harmony people, so we who work for peace must not falter. We must continue to pray for peace and to act for peace in whatever way we can, we must continue to speak for peace and to live the way of peace; to inspire others, we must continue to think of peace and to know that peace is possible. What we dwell upon we help to bring into manifestation. One little person, giving all of her time to peace, makes news. Many people, giving some of their time, can make history." -Peace Pilgrim ✌ #Steve #Honk4Peace #LA #PeacePilgrim #SaveHumanity #SpreadLove #CelebratePeace'
