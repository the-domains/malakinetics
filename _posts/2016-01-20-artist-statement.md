"The creative process, from concept to completion, is truly my passion. The
experience of completing a project can only be described in one way: it is like
turning myself inside out. Exposing my thoughts, beliefs, and emotions for the
entire world to see. My creative process is split in half between concept and
completion. The journey of how I get from one to the other is the "Magical
Experience" for me as an artist in this medium. Guided only by my wild internal eye
that when opened sees the world from inside out. Allowing me to articulate my
thoughts, moods, and examine some of my belief systems. This vision also permits
me to capture defining moments that are caught in a fleeting moment of time
delicately pressed up against an eternity of moving life seconds. My need is to
capture and preserve before extinction erases. I am a storyteller. My tools are
photography, filmmaking, and the written word." - Malakhi Simmons
